There are open fields beyond the garden and a swimming pool that is complimented by an outbuilding housing facilities such as a kitchen, wc and even your very own sauna - this really is the perfect place to entertain on those sunny summer days.As soon as you enter through the front door of this wonderful home you will appreciate the level of work that has gone into restoring the property and the large kitchen/dining area is a fantastic space that is enhanced by the majestic wooden beams that transverse its ceiling. A fabulous kitchen and island unit still leave a huge amount of space for a large dining table and sofas making this a really versatile room. From here the addition to the rear, the family room, could be utilised as a further large bedroom if so desired.Words and pictures simply cannot do this property any justice and when viewing you will get a warm feeling and a real buzz because aside from it's obvious charm it's setting is totally unique.What the Owner says:We loved the potential that the property offered and have really enjoyed renovating it and remodelling the property to suit our needs.We have installed underfloor heating in the bathrooms as well as downstairs and it's a great property for entertaining because there is so much space.We fell in love with the position and how safe it feels for our children and having those lovely field views behind are a real bonusRoom sizes:", "transport_information": [{"Laindon": "1.9 miles"}, {"Basildon": "2.2 miles"}, {"Billericay": "2.4 miles"}], "floor_plan": "https://lc.zoocdn.com/2d16ec582cb56051861072584169af48cac5acc9.png", "listing_id": "44683722", "postcode": "9UN CM12", "coordinate": ["51.59491", "0.428476"], "water_cost": 45, "council_tax": 240, "insurance_cost": 26, "energy_cost": 94}, "44683328": {"title": "2 bed terraced house for sale", "price": 79950, "crawling_time": "09-08-2017", "street_address": "Ellenborough Old Road, Maryport CA15", "num_of_bedrooms": 2, "num_of_bathrooms": 1, "monthview": 0, "agent_address": "Gate House, Hallwood Road, Lillyhall, Workington", "agent_name": "First Choice Move Ltd", "agent_phone": "+44 1946 848032", "first_published_date": "09-08-2017", "top3near_by": [["26-06-2017", 75000, "ca15-8hd"], ["22-06-2017", 140000, "ca15-6jl"], ["22-06-2017", 112000, "ca15-7ba"]], "num_of_receptions": "1", "images": ["https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/e1c446a0b847e905359a912ff99e316c2cab1f01.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/9743505f4e335ed6739d0e0f404b014a65cba723.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/231816dc5733af7874e8fe3cab409857172810d0.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/70f0fbd706209d7c7e70cb4ad81560ae92fe110a.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/8dd6d261e73a30ce2172a08947c74a8daf53d7d3.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/d23d7dfee5104b956ee07db12c4c44f7ace866c0.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/cd1ea46661ee32c42759488fad7d3cefe7ef0fcc.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/f44be2ecd75d3403f6786f2ca3c0e89daa6d0c7e.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/87399f34d36fb062fe81a0db83f51311826882bb.jpg", "https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/9b11039e36c78126c01e92b053f11fde234920f9.jpg"], "property_features": ["Well presented terraced property", "Good sized lounge", "Stylish bathroom", "Two double bedrooms plus loft room", "Large south facing rear yard", "No forward chain"], "property_description": "Situated just outside of Maryport Town Centre, 13 Ellenborough Old Road with a well presented two bed terraced property.
